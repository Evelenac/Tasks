        "3. Boiler 1 gas corrected volume is grouped at  $ 0\\ Sm^{3}$ which is congruent with the Heat Energy plot. Boiler 2 gas volume has its peak around $20-30\\ Sm^{3}$. Boiler 3 has an expected gas volume of about 0 and a few data within 20 and 50 $Sm^{3}$. The CHP gas volume is more likely to fall roughly 100 up to 160 $Sm^{3}$. And in comparison, the Boilers' volume is notably larger."

        "1. Columns *CHP_Electricity_Day(kWh)* and *CHP_Electricity_Night(kWh)* are a bit misleading since they are representing half a day performance. The readings with zero value in column Day means the CHP is generating electricity at night and the same the other way around.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Considerable amount of outliers in Boiler_2_Heat(kWh), Boiler_3_Heat(kWh) and their volumes.\n",

        "Graph 2: \n",
        "- A clear postivie linear relationship between boilers heat and volume.\n",
        "- CHP total energy relationship with volumen is a linear as well. \n",

        "3. CHP Electricity during day has a larger linear relationship with the heat energy generated than at night.  \n",

        "**Questions:**\n",
        "Is the boiler usage due to any seasonal effect?\n",
        "Do the CHP and boilers are used at the same intervals of time? How is it described the perfromance of the CHP regarding electricity and heat?"
